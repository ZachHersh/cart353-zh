### Artist's Statement 
The _concept_ of the game is to control weather phenomena for the purpose of destruction. The game is meant to poke fun at conspiracy theories and their doomsday perspective on the field of weather modifications. Weather modification is often used to create precipitation for crops and local water supply however conspiracy theories abound suggest that it is used for warfare. 
It is meant to be an action game with a lot of moving parts and constant chaos to keep the user on their toes. The weather phenomena in question will be a tornado and it will be guided across a simplistic prairie land like map of tornado alley in the United States where targets of value like vehicles and buildings can be destroyed for points. The points will displayed as dollars worth of damage to the landscape from the birds eye view of news helicopter covering the destructive path of the playerâ€™s twister. The game will use several forces such as gravity which will attract objects to the tornado and friction which will be imposed in greater or lower amounts on the objects attracted, depending on the health of the tornado. The player will try to keep the tornado within changing weather systems that will have positive or negative effects. Other forces will be used in the destruction of objects, whose parts will be flung about the map. The way the parts will break and the distances they will be flung will be determined by the forces.

box 2d, chapter 5\
\
get illustrator to export coordinates of vector points and handles.\
wanted to code sprites and objects in processing but performance is not even better so might as well use svg and png\'92s but wil still do it if i can get illustrator to export list of points and handles\
\
hard to make 50\'92s animation, outlines are key\
\
jetstream moves and fluctuates and undulates\
\
level sections load as tornado progresses\
\
location of tornado is +300 on 600 600 screen of map location, on full scrren will be more and will therefore need to figure out a way of moving tornado to edges of map when matrix is translated to the edge of the map.\
\
Make newscast style screen from helicopter view.  \
\
make objects seem like they are moving up tornado and dissapear to score points. Would 2-3 revolutions around tornado to score.}
